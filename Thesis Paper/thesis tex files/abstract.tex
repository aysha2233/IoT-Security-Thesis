\section{Abstract}
With the addition of embedded technologies into everyday electronic items, many homes have become ``smart'' homes. However, these items are highly susceptible to exploitation due to their lack of security features. In order to help protect their sensitive data, either in transit or stored on the network, we created a customizable security library that can be utilized by these devices. We implemented our security library on the Java ME embedded platform and utilized Bouncy Castle's open source cryptography distribution in order to create a security library that is flexible, portable, and resource efficient. Our experimental results suggest that our security library provides functionality for key exchange, encryption, authentication, and data integrity for these underpowered devices.
